# Influence-of-Fog-on-Lidar-and-Radar-Sensors
This project was part of my academics in the subject 'Lidar and Radar Systems' at Hochschule Ravenburg Weingarten.
In this project, we will be analysing point cloud data from different types of Lidar sensors and one Radar sensor and evaluate their performance.

Sensors Used in this Project are as follows-
1. Velodyne Puck
2. Blickfeld Cube 1
3. Texas Instruments radar sensor

A short report can be found in this repository which discusses the logic behind the code and then results in the form of histograms.

A link for the point cloud data is mentioned below. 
All credits for recording this point of cloud data go to the Ravensurg Weingarten University Of Applied Science. 
It's my kind request and, your moral responsibility to strictly use this point cloud data for educational use only and nothing else.
